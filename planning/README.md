our main task was creating a backlog which containing the priorities of user
stories.

The backlog is divided into 3 sections:

1. **Must Have** : these are the features that must be included in the project
   to enable it function well.

2. **Should Have** : these are features that necessary hence should be added to
   enhance functionality.

3. **Could Have** : These are non-essential features that can be either added to
   the project or left out depending on the users needs.
